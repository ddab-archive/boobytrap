		Skill Levels Dialogue Box
	</h1>
	<p>
		This dialogue box allows you to:
	</p>
	<ul class="unspaced">
		<li>
			select a new difficulty level for the current game grid
		</li>
		<li>
			edit the custom difficulty level for a game grid
		</li>
		<li>

		</li>
		<li>
			define a new game grid size
		</li>
		<li>
			delete an existing game grid size
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		These options are explained below.
	</p>
	<h2>

	</h2>
	<p>
		To add a new game grid size click the <span class="ui">Add new play
		area</span> button and enter the required number of columns and rows in
		the resulting <a href="newplayarea.htm">New Play Area dialogue box</a>.
		The new game grid now appears in the <span class="ui">Playing
		area</span> list box.
	</p>
	<h2>

		the <span class="ui">Playing area</span> list box and click the
		<span class="ui">Delete play area</span> button. Confirm that you want
		to go ahead with the deletion in the resulting confirmation dialogue box.
		Note that you can't delete the game grid currently in use and you can't
		delete all the game grids.
	</p>
	<h2>

		required grid size from the <span class="ui">Playing area</span> list
