		How to Play BoobyTrap!
	</h1>
	<p>
		You start a new game of <span class="prog">BoobyTrap!</span> by clicking
		the <span class="ui">New Game</span> button (a new game is automatically
		started when you load the program).
	</p>
	<p>
		If you think a square is safe you &quot;step&quot; on it by
		left-clicking it. If it's booby trapped it &quot;explodes&quot; and you
		loose the game. If the square is not booby trapped then it reveals some
		information to help you find booby trapped squares. If there are booby
		traps in squares adjacent to the one you step on the square displays to
		number of adjacent booby traps. If there a no adjacent squares with
		booby traps then the square and all surrounding squares are revealed
		until squares that have bounding booby traps are displayed.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can mark a square that you think is booby trapped by placing a
		&quot;flag&quot; on it. You do this by right-clicking the square. This
		marks the square with a skull and crossbones &quot;flag&quot;. Un-flag a
		flagged square by right clicking it again. You have as many flags at
		your disposal as there are booby trapped squares. You win the game by
		correctly flagging all the booby trapped squares.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're unsure about a square and want to return to it later you can
		place a query sign on in by holding down the
		<span class="keys">SHIFT</span> key and right clicking it. This places a
		question mark symbol on the square. You remove the mark by repeating the
		action.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you loose the game by stepping on a booby trapped square the program
		shows you all the booby trapped squares &ndash; the ones you correctly
		flagged are shown in red, the ones you didn't find in black and the ones
		you incorrectly flagged are shown with a green cross.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can surrender at any time after starting to play by clicking the
		<span class="ui">Surrender</span> button. This will display the location
		of all the booby traps &ndash; colour coded as described above.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your game is timed. If you win and your time is one of the three fastest
		times then your name and time is placed on a leader board.
