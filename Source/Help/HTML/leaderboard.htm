	<h1>
		The Leader Board
	</h1>
	<p>
		Each different playing grid in <span class="prog">BoobyTrap!</span> has
		its own leader board. Each leader board records the best three times for
		each of the difficulty levels Easy, Medium, Hard and Custom.
	</p>
	<p>
		The leader board is accessed by clicking the <span class="ui">High
		Scores</span> button. This displays the <a href="highscore.htm">High
		Scores dialogue box</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
