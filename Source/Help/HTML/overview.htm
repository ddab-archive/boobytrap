		<span class="prog">BoobyTrap!</span> displays a grid of squares some of
		which are booby trapped. The purpose of the game is to find all the
		booby trapped squares without stepping on one of them.
	</p>
	<p>
		The game grid can be customised by changing the size of the grid and the
		number of booby traps placed on the grid.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is also a leader board recording the players who successfully
		completed the game in the best times.
