		Customising BoobyTrap!
	</h1>
	<p>
		Although <span class="prog">BoobyTrap!</span> comes preconfigured with
		just one playing grid (size 12 &#215; 8) you can customise the size of
		the grid &ndash; any size between 6 &#215; 6 and 18 &#215; 32 is
		permitted. The program can remember details of more than one size of
		playing area and you can choose between previously defined sizes.
		<span class="prog">BoobyTrap!</span> comes with just one predefined
		playing grid of 12 &#215; 8.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each grid size also has three predefined levels of difficulty &ndash;
		Easy, Medium and Hard. At each increasing level of difficulty more booby
		traps are hidden under the grid. There is also one custom level of
		difficulty where the number of booby traps is defined by the player.
		Until the player sets this value it defaults to be the same as the
		Medium level of difficulty.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each play area has its own leader board, divided into different sections
		for each level of difficulty.
	</p>
	<p>
		To choose a different size of grid or a different difficulty level, or
		to add a new grid size, click the <span class="ui">Skill Level</span>
		button to display the <a href="skilllevels.htm">Skill Levels dialogue
		box</a>.
