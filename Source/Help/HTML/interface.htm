	<h1>
		The User Interface
	</h1>
	<p>
		<span class="prog">BoobyTrap</span>'s user interface has three main
		areas:

	</h2>
	<p>
		The large area on the left main window is where the game grid is
		displayed. See <a href="playing.htm">How to play the game</a> for
		details of how you interact with game grid.
	</p>
	<h2>
		The Button Bar
	</h2>
	<p>
		The button bar appears down the right hand side of the main window. It
		contains the following command buttons:
	</p>
	<ul class="spaced">
		<li>
			<div>
				<span class="ui">New Game</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				This button starts a new game &ndash; if there is a game in
				progress it abandons that game.
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div>
				<span class="ui">Surrender</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				This button is only available when a game is in progress (i.e.

			</div>
			<div>

				<a href="skilllevels.htm">Skill Levels dialogue box</a> that
				allows you to change the grid size or difficulty level and
				define new playing grids.
			</div>
		</li>

				author and copyright information.

		</li>
		<li>
			<div>
				<span class="ui">Exit</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				The <span class="ui">Exit</span> button quits the program.
			</div>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		The Status Bar
	</h2>
	<p>
		The status bar appears across the bottom of the main window. It is
		divided into four main panels:
	</p>
	<ol class="spaced">
		<li>
			The status panel gives details of the status of the game &ndash; it
			tells you how to start a new game, if the game is in progress and if
			you've won or lost.
		</li>
		<li>
			The timer panel displays elapsed time when a game is in progress or
			the time taken for the game once the game is over.
		</li>
		<li>
			The flags panel shows how many flags are available for you to place
			&ndash; this reduces as you place the flags.
		</li>
		<li>
			The skill level panel displays the current game's grid size and
			number of booby traps hidden under the grid.
		</li>
	</ol>
