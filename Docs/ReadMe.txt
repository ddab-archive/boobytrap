BoobyTrap! requires Windows 2000 and later.

The program is distributed in a zip archive which contains two files –
ReadMe.txt (this file) and BoobyTrap-Setup-x.x.x.exe, where x.x.x. is the
program's version number. Extract both files from the archive.

BoobyTrap-Setup-x.x.x.exe is the installation program. Double-click
BoobyTrap-Setup-x.x.x.exe. The installer is a standard wizard style Windows
installer. Follow the instructions in the wizard. You must accept the program's
license to proceed. Once the license is accepted you can configure the
installation directory and the program group name. Once the installation has
completed you have the option to display ReadMe.txt and to start the program.

uninstaller.

1.  Start the Windows Control Panel and select "Programs and Features" (a.k.a
    "Add / Remove Programs").

2.  Select DelphiDabbler BoobyTrap! v1.x.x, where x.x is the minor version
